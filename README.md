## Need

I had to write an examination. Since a selected students were there in the exam and we were unknow to each other, and my Prof didn't have the details with him, i wrote this script.

## Allowed

This helped to find out the details of all the students enrolled with a particular subject id similar to the test which I am appearing. So I could know there names and registration id. This lead me to create a whatsapp group for us which helped us to write the exam by discussing and learing important topics.

This code is kinda cool since its the first time I had a need and I resolved it via coding and scraping.
